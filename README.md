# ''Situating the Actual within the Space of the Possible: Parameter Space Structure and Degeneracy In Brain-Body-Environment Systems''

This repository contains the source code to perform the evolutionary runs described in the paper titled ''Situating the Actual within the Space of the Possible: Parameter Space Structure and Degeneracy In Brain-Body-Environment Systems.'' To compile the code, run the makefile provided. 

The repository also contains the resulting data from the 10,000 evolutionary runs performed and analyzed in that paper in WL (Wolfram Language) format: allfit.wl contains all the final fitness of each run, and allparams.wl contains the neural parameters of each final individual from each run.
