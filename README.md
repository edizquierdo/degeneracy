# ''Situating the Actual within the Space of the Possible: Parameter Space Structure and Degeneracy In Brain-Body-Environment Systems''

This repository contains the source code to perform the evolutionary runs described in the paper titled ''Situating the Actual within the Space of the Possible: Parameter Space Structure and Degeneracy In Brain-Body-Environment Systems.'' To compile the code, run the makefile provided. 

The repository also contains the resulting data from the 10,000 evolutionary runs performed and analyzed in that paper in WL (Wolfram Language) format: allfit.wl contains all the final fitness of each run, and allparams.wl contains the neural parameters of each final individual from each run. 

The “Figures” folder contains all Wolfram Mathematica code and data required to generate the graphics used to produce the figures in the paper. First evaluate all cells in the “Initialization.nb” notebook. Then the figures and supplemental figures graphics can be generated by evaluating all cells in the “Figure.nb” and “SupplementalFigures.nb” notebooks, respectively. Note that some evaluations may take a very long time to complete.
